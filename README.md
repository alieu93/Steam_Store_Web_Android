# Steam_Store_Web_Android

# Description:
This is a personal project that uses the Steam store (http://www.steampowered.com) data directly from their HTML source files and parses them in order to display them in a viewable format on Android.

Using the direct HTML source files is required because Steam's Web API appears to not have any kind of support for their storefront.

As of this moment (Feburary 28 2017), it only displays the "Upcoming Releases", but is intended to be able to display much more in the future.
